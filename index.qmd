# About {.unnumbered}

On this page you find the materials for the workshop *Introduction to R for SAS programmers*.
The workshop provides an RStudio cloud workspace, so you don't need to have R and RStudio locally installed. 


If you want to participate in this workshop using your local machine, you need to download the data first. 
Executing the following chunk in R on your machine will create and populate a data folder in your current working directory. 
If you work on the RStudio cloud instance provided by us via link, you do not need to run this chunk.  
```{r}
#| eval: false

# set paths and data names
external.path <- 
  "https://github.com/pharmaverse/intro-to-r-for-sas-programmers-workshop/blob/main/data"

local.path <- ("data")
subdir <- file.path(local.path, "save_data")
files <- c(
  "adsl.RData", 
  "adsl.csv", 
  "adsl.sas7bdat", 
  "adsl_1.RData", 
  "adsl_2.RData", 
  "ae.rds", 
  "dm.rds"
  )

# external files (with path)
urls <- file.path(external.path, paste(files, "raw=true", sep = "?"))
# local files (with path)
dest <- file.path(local.path, files)

# create data folder in wd
if (!file.exists(local.path)) {
  dir.create(local.path)
  # subdirectory
  dir.create(subdir)
}

# download files if needed
download.file(urls, destfile = dest)
  
```
