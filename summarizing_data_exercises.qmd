## Setup

```{r message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
dm <- readRDS("data/dm.rds")
ae <- readRDS("data/ae.rds")
```

## Exercise 1

Count the number of *overall* adverse events per subject and sort the output such that the subject with the highest overall number of adverse events appears first.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show solution"
ae %>% 
  group_by(USUBJID) %>% 
  summarise(n_ae = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n_ae))
```

## Exercise 2

Count the overall number of *serious* adverse events per treatment arm (`ACTARM`).

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show solution"
ae %>% 
  filter(AESER == "Y") %>% 
  group_by(ACTARM) %>% 
  summarise(n = n())
```

## Exercise 3

Find the lowest and highest `AGE` per treatment arm.

```{r}
dm %>% 
  group_by(ARM) %>% 
  summarise(youngest = min(AGE, na.rm = TRUE), oldest = max(AGE, na.rm = TRUE))
```
